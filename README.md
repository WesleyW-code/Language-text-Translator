# Language-text-Translator

##A simple language text translator##

Doing this task was to test my understanding of using a GUI and the packages needed to compile this along with the Translate package which allows me to do the translations in the end. I also learned how to convert a Python file to an executable wich has been added to the repository. I followed a guide on making this translator but added my own tweeks to help me understand the packages and code better. 

This program will allow you to translate text from one language to another. i am able to add more languages if needed but used the set of languages provided for this example.
I used a package called "auto-py-to-exe" to convert my python file to an executable, which also allows me to convert other file types. It also allows me to add icons to the executables along with other prefrences.
